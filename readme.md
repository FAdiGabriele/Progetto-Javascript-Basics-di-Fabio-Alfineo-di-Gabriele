Hi! This is a Start2Impact project for the exam of Javascript Basics ðŸ˜„

Here you see the result: [site](https://fadg-javascript-project.netlify.app)

## About the project

This web application aims to allow you to measure how many people are in a given place and compare it with the maximum capacity of the place where those people are.

## Project features

In this application you can easily keep an eye on the number of people in a given place.

Whenever a person enters or leaves you can easily update the number of people in the place via convenient "+" or "-" buttons.

If the change, on the other hand, is a large number of people at the same time you can use the manual update so that you can immediately enter the updated number of people present.
